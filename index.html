        <p>Humanoid objects, which appear almost like humans, though not exactly, tend to elicit feelings of eeriness in humans. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>. This can come from computer animations and robotics alike. This concept was first discovered in 1970 by a robotics professor, Masahiro Mori.</p>

        <p>Unsurprisingly the uncanny is fairly prevalent in movies (especially ones that use things like CGI) as well as video games.  The main reason for this is while technology has made it possible for something to look close to a real human the slightly off parts will end making the whole thing <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/danmeth/welcome-to-uncanny-valley?utm_term=.buEarBxVw#.oe2wOoKd9">really creepy</a>.  One good example that I can think of are the kids from the Polar Express.</p>

        <p> In our modern day (2017) we are experiencing the developement of robots that can show real evidence of the uncanny valley.  On on the positive side of the valley is the toy robot dog from Sony, the <a href="http://aibo.sony.jp/en/">Aibo</a> (above image - left) which is very cute.  Then we can compare it to the the Boston Dynamics <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot-mini">Spot Mini</a> (above image - right,) which is not so cute.

        <p>As the technologies keep developing(for example CGI, 3D printing, Machine Learning, virtual Reality...and so on), human eventually overcome all visual uncanny valley effect in the producing process of <a href="http://www.adweek.com/creativity/goodbye-uncanny-valley-what-does-the-future-hold-for-photoreal-cgi/">visual products</a>. When the technologies develop into a certain level, All kinds of human or    animal imitation could be as real as 100%. In other words, the uncanny valley side effect will be solved. The only reason for the existence  of Uncanny Valley theory is for the purpose of art or movie creation.</p>

        <p>As we progress towards realistic androids and better graphics, both in video games and movies, the uncanny valley is becoming something we're seeing more often. The sense of eeriness humans get from the uncanny valley is likely temporary, as advancements in technology will iron out these flaws in the appearance. However, if nothing else the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley">the uncanny valley</a> helps give us a glimpse into where humans draw the line between acceptable technology, and nightmare future.</p>
